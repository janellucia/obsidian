    // video: GlassAtlas1,
    image: Glass1,

    imageThree: Glass3,
    description: "A meditation on memory and migration, “Glass Atlas” blends natural landscapes with fragmented narration to explore the emotional imprint of distance. Shot entirely on 16mm, the film draws the viewer into dreamlike vignettes of light, motion, and recollection. Mira’s signature soft lensing and atmospheric pacing give each frame a painterly, timeless quality.",

    image: Monoliths1,
    imageTwo: Monoliths2,
    imageThree: Monoliths3,
    description: "Set against a coastal cliffside, “Monoliths” features three vertical sculptures carved from volcanic rock, referencing ancient wayfinding structures and planetary alignment. Theo’s work here considers scale, erosion, and human presence in a changing world. The installation invites viewers to walk among the forms, becoming part of the landscape and the ritual.",

    artist: "Lena Marceau — Photographer",
    medium: "Portrait series",
    image: Nocturne1,
    imageTwo: Nocturne2,
    imageThree: Nocturne3,
    description: "A quiet exploration of solitude after dark, “Nocturne Studies” is a photographic series captured between midnight and dawn over several months. Using only ambient light, Lena composes intimate portraits that feel both cinematic and deeply personal. The work dwells in shadow, in moments when emotion rises to the surface unspoken.",

    artist: "Isolde Vance — Conceptual Artist",
    medium: "Immersive installation",
    image: Echo1,
    imageTwo: Echo2,
    imageThree: Echo3,
    description: "Echo Bloom” is a sensory installation combining audio field recordings, layered projection, and suspended archival prints. Visitors walk through a temporal corridor where lost languages and forgotten botanicals are made tangible. Isolde’s work dissolves boundaries between past and present, offering a tactile experience of remembrance and decay.",

    medium: "Generative video + soundscape",
    image: Static1,
    imageTwo: Static2,
    imageThree: Static3,
    description: "Built using real-time code and motion synthesis, “Static Choir” generates a constantly shifting audiovisual experience. It explores the digital noise of collective thought — anonymous fragments of text, glitch harmonics, pulses of light. Nico’s project feels simultaneously futuristic and primal, an algorithm singing in tongues.",

    title: "Thorn Rituals",
    slug: "thorn-rituals",
    artist: "Lucien Hart — Digital Illustrator",
    medium: "Illustrated short story",
    image: Thorn1,
    imageTwo: Thorn2,
    imageThree: Thorn3,
    description: "A visual retelling of a lesser-known myth from the Andean mountains, “Thorn Rituals” combines ink textures, digital layering, and surrealist design. Lucien’s illustrations invoke a shadowy world where flora, fate, and feminine power entwine. Each panel is steeped in ancient symbolism, with modern tension humming beneath the surface.",
